# auto-scan-sheets
A project developed for a previous job to automate a tedious daily task I was in charge of.  

The code uploaded has been modified to keep aspects of the company I worked for confidential, as the code is meant to work on their private information. The spreadsheet accompanied along with it has also been scrubbed of as much information as possible, while still being usuable for example purposes.
